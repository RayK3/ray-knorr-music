export const musicLongBio = `For his fourth birthday, Ray Knorr received a toy fiddle from his uncle Mike, and by the fall he had asked his mom if he could take fiddle lessons. Studying under the great Everett Larson in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Ray was introduced to the wonderful Canadian Old Time fiddling scene. 

Ray grew up competing at fiddle competitions and attending camps across Saskatchewan and Western Canada, notably the John Arcand Fiddle Fest, Emma Lake Fiddle Camp, and Camp Calvin. His family moved to Regina, where he performed and recorded two studio albums with his siblings Tash and Ben as “The Knorr Kids”. Ray has received many accolades from Canadian fiddle competitions, as a two-time Grand North American Fiddle Champion, a three-time Saskatchewan Fiddle Champion, and a four-time finalist at the Canadian Grandmasters fiddling competition by the time he was 24. 

In high school, Ray filled his free time with music, joining the school choir, vocal jazz ensemble, chamber choir, concert band, jazz band and string orchestra. Ray was a violist in the South Saskatchewan Youth Orchestra for two years. Between high school, and the Regina-based theatre company Sterling Productions, Ray played bass guitar in the pit band for over 20 musicals from 2014 to 2019. 

After graduating from the University of Regina with a Software Systems Engineering degree in 2021, Ray lived in various places across Canada, working remotely as a Software Engineer. Based in Vancouver in 2022, Ray had the privilege of singing with the incredible Vancouver Youth Choir. While with VYC he had the opportunity to arrange and perform the fiddle part for “Canadian Medley” at the 2023 World Symposium on Choral Music in İstanbul, Türkiye. Also in Vancouver, Ray began performing as a Sofar Sounds artist both individually and as a duo with fiddler Kai Gronberg. 

At the end of the summer of 2023, after a cross-country road trip, Ray moved to his current home of Charlottetown, PEI, where he fell in love with the fiddling traditions of the Canadian Maritimes. Ray quickly began performing, teaching and hosting sessions locally. With guitarist Tom Gammons, he formed the versatile trad duo Gammons & Knorr.

In July of 2024, Ray participated in Ethno Estonia, an ethnomusicology camp held near Viljandi, Estonia. He and his cohort learned, arranged, and performed traditional music from across Europe and the world at the Viljandi Folk Festival.

Ray continues to enjoy learning, teaching, and immersing himself in the world of traditional music and is currently working on recording/touring an EP with Gammons & Knorr in late 2024/early 2025.

export const gammonsKnorrBio = `Ray Knorr is a fiddler from Saskatchewan, where you find oases of deeply rooted traditional music in the form of fiddle camps and competitions. Tom Gammons is a guitarist from Montana, but did most of his yearly learning at the Kenosee Lake Kitchen Party in southeast Saskatchewan. This is where the duo first crossed paths - as young traditional musicians preparing to explore beyond the communities that molded them. Ray headed west to Vancouver after studying software engineering in Regina. Tom made a beeline for the Maritimes and studied at Charlottetown’s School of Performing Arts. Along the way, and in their own way, both musicians gained influence from Irish, Scottish, Scandinavian, and American old-time folk styles. 
	
  Five years after they parted in the prairies, they find themselves on Prince Edward Island, both driven by the search for the soul of these different styles, to find the through line between traditions and, above all else, play music that speaks to the heart.
